0.0009    Mon Jan 28 2013

   - avoid "defined @HIDDEN" which generates a warning since Perl 5.15.7  CPAN RT #74225

0.0008    Thu Nov 15 2007

   - no real code changes
   - make t/050child-processes.t less clever for Windows' sake: which choked with too long
     argument and exec()

0.0007    Mon Nov  5 2007

   - promoted: no longer a development release

0.0006_01

   - some POD fixes
   - new option -from:children makes the selected modules hidden from process children as well
     (thanks to David Cantrell)

0.0005    Wed May 30 2007

   - code reformatting with perltidy
   - now warns about already loaded modules
   - META.yml is auto-generated by Makefile.PL
   - a bit of refactoring to affect code readability
   - side effect: warnings are emitted at compile time and at every import call - a hopefully
     better timing
   - the package variable @HIDDEN does not change anymore

0.0004    Tue May 29 2007

   - slight implementation change preparing for the big time

0.0003    Wed Oct 4 2006

   - not a development version anymore
   - get rid of warning at "t/003user.t"
   - new test "t/098pod-coverage.t"

0.00_02   Sun Sep 25 2005

   - lifted the requirement on perl 5.8: now 5.6.1 will do  (because it may use File::Temp to
     fake bad modules)

0.00_01   Tue Sep 20 2005

   - first release to CPAN

0.00_00   Tue Sep 13 2005
